# Prerequisites

For the initial setup of this page to work, you need to have Ruby, RubyGems and Bundler installed.

## Ruby

Ruby comes preinstalled on OSX, so if you're using a Mac you're good to go! If you're using another OS, please check the ruby-lang.org [installation page](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)!

### RubyGems

To install RubyGems, go to the rubygems.com [download page](https://rubygems.org/pages/download) and download the latest version for your OS!

#### Bundler

With RubyGems installed, enter `sudo gem install bundler` into your terminal and bundler will be installed!
