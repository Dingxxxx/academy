# App for the React tutorial

This is the finished application we build from ground up in the React tutorial. The tutorial has six parts.

## Parts

1. **Introduction**: Set up and explain the basic foundation, (Node, npm, Modules with Browserify) before diving into React.js specifics for beginners.

2. **Redux**: Dive into application state management, explaining the action -> store -> render loop along the way.

3. **Plotly**: Making charts with Plotly.js in combination with React.js

4. **ImmutableJS**: ImmutableJS is great for a performance boost and easier maintainability.

5. **Testing**: Test the application with Mocha, `mjackson/expect` and `airbnb/enzyme`.

6. **React Native**: Introduction to writing native applications with React Native.
